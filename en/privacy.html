We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our application or services or transacting business with us. By using our website or application (our "Service"), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. WE DO NOT PERFORM CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.</p>

	<p class="p_h2">Information we collect about you</p>

	<p class="p_h2">What Other Websites Collect From You</p>
	<p class="p_content">Our Site contains links to other websites. You need to be aware that when you click on these links and visit these other websites, (regardless of whether or not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property), we do NOT control these other websites or these other website's business practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other websites. Each of these websites should have its own Privacy Policy if it is collecting personal information about you. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.</p>

	<p class="p_h2">How we use the information we collect</p>
	<p class="p_content">1. How We Use Personal Information:We may use your phone number, contacts, email address and your other personal information to help us efficiently operate the Site, to contact you in connection with your membership and other activities on the Site (including, but not limited to, phone number, contacts, confirmation emails or important news that could affect your relationship with our site), and to forward messages to you from other ViVi users. These types of communications are known as "Operational Communications." To operate the Site, we may share your personal information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, email origination, receipt or support services, and customer relationship management services. We require these entities not to use your information for any other purpose. Besides, any third party with whom we are allowed to share your personal information is authorized to use your personal information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Please read the information below under the heading "Special Cases in which we Share Personal and Financial Information" to learn more ways where we may share your personal information.</p>
	<p class="p_content">2. How We Use Financial Information:To process purchases, we may require your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. We use your financial information to, if applicable, check your qualifications and to bill you our service. By making a purchase, or engaging in any other kind of activity or transaction that uses financial information, on the Site, you consent to our providing your financial information to our service providers and to such third parties as we determine are necessary to support and process your activities and transactions, as well as to your credit card issuer for their purposes. These third parties may include the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process and support the transaction or activity.</p>
	<p class="p_content">3. Location Information and Services: This service includes location based services and features. These features are used to connect you to other users based upon your geographic location, and provide other services that personalize your experience. To implement these features we collect your location data, including but not limited to GPS data, WiFi data, and cell tower data.</p>
	<p class="p_content">4. Special Cases in which we Share Personal and Financial Information: Your personal information, Certified Financial Information or financial information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy or to comply with the law or to protect the interests or safety of ViVi or other visitors to the Site.</p>
	<p class="p_content">5. How We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information: We may review all your demographic information. We may use public information to enable other users to determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We may use demographic information to tailor the Site and cater to your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to ViVi users, so that we may target specific ads at specific demographic groups. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell advertisers which particular ViVi users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic group. In addition, we may also use the information you provided during registration, to automatically set up an email account for you at the registered site, so that you can make online dating and social networking more convenient and secure.</p>

	<p class="p_h2">With whom we share your information</p>
	<p>1. Disclosure to Your Matches: As an integral part of providing the ViVi service, we will disclose your profile information to your matches. Photos and other profile information posted by you will be available to subscribers that are matched with you. We may also make features available enabling your matches to share your profile information, including photos, with members of their social network(s). We never share your contact information with your matches.</p>
	<p>2. Disclosure By Law:You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law); protect or defend ViVi's, or a third party's, rights or property; or protect someone's health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened.</p>
	<p>3. Disclosure to Protect Abuse Victims: Notwithstanding any other provision of this privacy statement or our Terms and Conditions of Service, we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to disclose any information that you submit to the services, if in our sole opinion, we suspect or have reason to suspect, that the information involves a party who may be the victim of abuse in any form.

Information may be disclosed to authorities that we, in our sole discretion, deem appropriate to handle such disclosure.

You hereby acknowledge and agree that we are permitted to make such disclosure.</p>
	<p>4. Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties by Us:We may share your non-PII with third parties, but not in a manner that would reveal your identity. We may share your PII, sometimes in conjunction with your non-PII, with service providers that may be associated with us to perform functions on our behalf.

Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize. In addition, from time to time, we may share PII (such as e-mail or mailing address) about our user base with carefully selected third parties, so they can offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our users.

Your information will not be transferred until you actually accept the offer. You may opt-out of the offer at any time up until this point. Please refer to the third party provider's own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding how your information is used by such providers. Please be aware that these offers may be presented on pages framed by a ViVi website. We do this to provide a seamless experience.
