	<p class="issue">1. How does ViVi app work?</p>
	<p class="answer">Tap ‘heart’ icon to like someone anonymously, swipe up to pass someone that you are not interested in. Mutual likes will be made a match and it will start a new conversation for both of you.</p>

	<p class="issue">2. How do I set my gender preference?</p>
	<p class="answer">Tap the ‘filter’ icon in the top right corner, then you can set your preferred gender.</p>

	<p class="issue">3. How to edit my profile?</p>
	<p class="answer">Tap ‘Me’ icon on the bottom navigation bar, then tap ‘Edit Profile’ to update your profile information. You can update your profile picture, videos and personal details. Make sure that you hit ‘Save’ on the upper right corner before you leave the page.</p>

	<p class="issue">4. Why use ‘Super Like’ ？</p>
	<p class="answer">‘Super Like’  is a way to tell someone that you’re especially interested in them. It lets users alert a potential match before they pass, displaying a little notification ‘star’ icon when the Super Liking user's head profile is served to the object of their desire. "Super Like" may make a match up to several times. </p>

	<p class="issue">5. I can’t seem to get any matches. Help!</p>
	<div class="answer">
		<p>We’re sorry to hear that. There are some tips for you.</p>
		<p>Have you been liking someone? The more people you like, the larger the possibility that someone will like you back. Keep liking! </p>
		<p>Your account may still be in under review. This means that your profile won’t be seen by other people until your account has been validated by our review team. To avoid running into these issues, please make sure that you use real photos and to behave properly.</p>
